    "description" : "One of our direct trade relationships, Don Francisco's farm is located at the end of a long, winding dirt road. The farm spans down a steep slope, with his house situated in the center. He cultivates predominately caturra along with a few bourbon trees. The trees feel healthy and vital in the damp atmosphere, and appear to have a strong yield. Coffee is depulped, fermented, and washed on the farm. Drying is done at a local mill. He stays involved in the entire process, only allowing two or three other people to help him with picking the ripe cherries. While fermenting the coffee, he sleeps next to the fermentation tanks letting him constantly monitor his coffee. Profits from a harvest are often put back into the farm in an effort to continually improve to quality of his crop. - See more at: http://www.joebeanroasters.com/coffee/nicaragua_don_francisco_.html#sthash.CFwZK6c9.dpuf"
