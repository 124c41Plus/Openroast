# OS X Installation Process
You do not need to install any software other than what is in the contents of the installation package.  All necessary software is provided in the package.

## Software and Driver Installation
1. Download the latest Openroast Mac installation package from https://github.com/Roastero/Openroast/releases.
2. Double-click on the DMG file.  This will mount the disk image.  It will look like this.
