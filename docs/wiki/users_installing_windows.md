# Windows Installation Process
You do not need to install any software other than what is in the contents of the installation package.  All necessary software is provided in the package.

## Software and Driver Installation
1. Download the latest Openroast Windows installation package from https://github.com/Roastero/Openroast/releases.
2. Double-click on the ZIP file.
3. In the ZIP file, you will find 3 files:
    1. a README file that is essentially the same as what you are reading here;
    2. *CH341SER.EXE.zip*, which is the installer for the Windows USB drivers required to communicate withthe Freshroast SR700;
    3. *Openroast_v1.2.x_Win10_xxbit.EXE*, which is the Windows 10 installer for either 64-bit or 32-bit Windows, depending on which Windows package you downloaded.
4. Next, you may have to install the driver.
	1. If you previously installed the Freshroast SR700 app that coems with the roaster, the drivers have already been installed and therefore, you do not need to install the drivers. Go to step 5. 
	2. If you have not installed the Freshroast SR700 app, then go ahead and double click on *CH341SER.EXE.zip*.  This will open the zip file.  Now, double-click on *CH341SER.EXE*, and install the USB driver.
5. Finally, install the Openroast app.  Double-click on *Openroast_v1.2.x_Win10_xxbit.EXE*, which will install the Openroast app.
